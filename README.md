My first ever project written in JavaScript
Originally deployed September 28, 2017

This app is pulling weather data from Open Weather.  https://openweathermap.org/api
It displays local weather for any city or zip code you search with single, 3, and 5 day forecasts. 
Fully functional on mobile devices.
